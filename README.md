# Calendarian
This is an application written using the [Hilla](https://hilla.dev) framework for mood tracking and journaling.

## Planned features

- [ ] Use Hilla with Flux to stream notifications from backend to frontend
- [ ] Multi-modal presentation of data with different services for the same data


# Observations
+ Hilla generates an OpenAPI spec from the Java endpoints ad-hoc and uses it to generate the frontend API.
- Only officially supports React at the moment, [by choice of the developers](https://github.com/vaadin/hilla/issues/746#issuecomment-1854714358)

# TODOs
- Request error handling 
- User authentication 
- Use proper MySQL
